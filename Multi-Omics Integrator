# Mini Multi-Omics Integrator 🧬

This notebook is a small end-to-end project that integrates multiple -omics data
(gene expression, copy-number, mutations, protein) to classify breast cancer subtypes
using a real multi-omics dataset (TCGA BRCA, via Kaggle).

1. Load a real multi-omics dataset.
2. Separate features by omics type using column-name prefixes.
3. Train a baseline model using a single omics type.
4. Train an integrated model using multiple omics types together.
5. Compare performance and interpret which omics contribute most.

This is intentionally "mini": it uses classical machine learning and basic feature
selection to make the analysis approachable for me
